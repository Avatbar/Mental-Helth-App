# mental_health_app

MindPet is a Flutter-based mobile application designed for Android users to improve and monitor their mental health. The app incorporates the nostalgic concept of a Tamagotchi, where users care for a virtual pet that reflects their mental well-being. By engaging with their MindPet, users will be encouraged to practice self-care routines, track their mood, and receive mental health tips. As the user maintains good mental health practices, their MindPet thrives, creating a fun and interactive way to focus on mental wellness.
